<h1>George Soros: The Controversial Figure Behind Global Finance and Politics</h1>

<p class="date">Published on April 15, 2025</p>

<h2>Who is George Soros and what is he known for?</h2>

<p class="first-letter">George Soros (born György Schwartz) is an American financier, investor, and philanthropist of Hungarian origin, born in 1930. He is the founder of the "Open Society Foundations" network, an advocate for open society theory, and an opponent of "market fundamentalism." Soros is renowned for his successful, sometimes speculative, operations in financial markets, including the famous "Black Wednesday" of 1992, when he reportedly earned over a billion dollars from the fall of the British pound sterling. Beyond his financial activities, Soros is actively engaged in philanthropy through his foundations, supporting projects in education, human rights, democracy, and science. His work has received both positive assessments and criticism, and he has become the subject of numerous conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Few figures in modern finance and politics evoke such strong and polarized reactions as George Soros. To some, he represents the pinnacle of financial acumen and philanthropic generosity. To others, he embodies the dangers of unchecked financial speculation and ideological overreach. This dichotomy itself reflects the complexity of the man who has navigated the highest echelons of global finance while simultaneously working to reshape societies according to his vision.</p>

<p>As I delve deeper into this enigmatic figure in my book <a href="../books/george-soros">George Soros: The Man the World Hates</a>, the story of Soros begins long before his birth. In 1915, during World War I, his father Tivadar Schwartz, an Austro-Hungarian Lieutenant, was captured by the Russian Imperial Army and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp near Khabarovsk. After a daring escape along the Trans-Siberian Railway and a two-year journey battling cold, hunger, and constant pursuit, Tivadar reached Budapest in 1920 where he met his future wife, Elizabeth Szucs. Their son György Schwartz, later known as George Soros, was born in August 1930.</p>

<h2>What is George Soros's role in the financial world?</h2>

<p>George Soros is considered one of the most successful and influential financiers of the 20th century. His career began in the 1950s on Wall Street, where he was involved in international securities arbitrage. In 1969, he founded the Double Eagle hedge fund, which later evolved into the famous Quantum Group, bringing him enormous wealth. Soros is known for his ability to anticipate and capitalize on fluctuations in financial markets, as well as for applying his own theory of market reflexivity. He has made numerous large speculative deals that influenced currency rates and entire national economies. Despite his successes, his activities have also faced criticism, and he has been accused of using insider information and engaging in speculation that leads to financial crises. In 2011, Soros announced the closure of his investment fund to external investors and focused on managing his own capital and his family's assets.</p>

<blockquote>"Markets are constantly in a state of uncertainty and flux, and money is made by discounting the obvious and betting on the unexpected." — George Soros</blockquote>

<p>What many don't realize is that Soros developed his famous theory of reflexivity during his time at the London School of Economics. This theory proposes that market participants' beliefs and expectations influence prices, which in turn affect those same beliefs and expectations, creating a feedback loop that can lead to market bubbles and crashes. This understanding guided many of his most successful investments, including his legendary bet against the British pound.</p>

<h2>What is the "Soros Foundation" and what are its main activities?</h2>

<p>The "Soros Foundation" (the Open Society Foundations network) is one of the largest private charitable organizations in the world, founded by George Soros. The first foundation was established in Hungary in 1984, and subsequently the network spread to many countries, especially in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The main objective of the foundations is to support the development of open society, democratic institutions, human rights, freedom of speech, education, science, and healthcare. The foundations provide grants to non-profit organizations, educational institutions, research centers, and individual activists working in these fields. The foundations' activities cover a wide range of topics, including anti-corruption efforts, support for independent media, protection of minority rights, development of civil society, and integration of countries into the global community.</p>

<p>The scale of Soros's philanthropic activities is remarkable by any standard. As of 2025, his foundations have distributed more than $32 billion across 100+ countries, making him one of history's most generous philanthropists. Yet this generosity has been met with both gratitude and suspicion, particularly in regions where his liberal democratic values clash with nationalist or authoritarian perspectives.</p>

<p>His philanthropic efforts were profoundly shaped by his wartime experiences in Hungary. In my extensive research for <a href="../books/george-soros">George Soros: The Man the World Hates</a>, I discovered that Soros's first significant philanthropic initiative in Hungary was remarkably practical: he funded the installation of photocopiers in libraries—a revolutionary act in a communist state where information was tightly controlled. This seemingly small step represented a profound commitment to the free flow of information that would characterize his philanthropy for decades to come.</p>

<h2>What are George Soros's political activities and lobbying efforts?</h2>

<p>George Soros actively participates in the political life of many countries, acting as a sponsor and influential lobbyist. It is believed that his foundations played an important role in the fall of communist regimes in Eastern Europe in 1989. In the United States, Soros is a major donor to the Democratic Party and supports progressive political initiatives, including drug policy reforms and the fight against climate change. He has openly criticized the policies of several leaders and governments, including Donald Trump and Viktor Orbán. Soros has also advocated for financial assistance to Ukraine and condemned Russian aggression. His political activism and funding of various organizations provoke sharp controversy and accusations of attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign states.</p>

<p>The intersection of Soros's financial resources and political convictions has made him an influential voice in global affairs, but also a lightning rod for criticism. His willingness to fund political causes aligned with his worldview—from campaign finance reform to marijuana legalization—represents an unusual merging of financial power with political activism that challenges traditional notions of influence in democratic societies.</p>

<p>Soros's first foray into the political sphere came in 1987 when his private plane landed in Moscow—a rare occurrence for a foreigner in the Soviet Union at that time. He met with high-ranking Soviet officials including Chairman of the Council of Ministers Nikolai Ryzhkov and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Andrei Gromyko. While officially there to assess the situation in the USSR during the early stages of perestroika, Soros was already laying groundwork for what would become a decades-long campaign to influence post-Soviet societies.</p>

<h2>What about George Soros's personal life and family?</h2>

<p>George Soros has been married three times and has five children from his first two marriages: Robert Daniel Soros, Andrea Soros Colombel, Jonathan Tivadar Soros (from his first marriage to Annaliese Witschak), and Alexander Soros, Gregory James Soros (from his second marriage to Susan Weber). In 2013, he married Tamiko Bolton, who at the time of the wedding was a 40-year-old yoga instructor, while Soros was 82 years old. His son Alexander Soros is also involved in philanthropy and heads the Alexander Soros Foundation, which supports social justice and human rights. Alexander shares his father's ideas and continues his work, serving as the chairman of the Open Society Foundations.</p>

<p>Behind the public persona lies a complex family life that has evolved alongside Soros's growing wealth and influence. His marriages—each marking distinct chapters in his life—reflect the personal odyssey of a man whose focus remained primarily on his financial and philanthropic enterprises rather than domestic life. Yet the Soros family name has become a dynasty of sorts, with his children inheriting not only wealth but also the mantle of his philosophical vision.</p>

<p>In examining Soros's family dynamics for my book, I found that his relationship with his children reflects the complexity of his character. His firstborn son Robert initially followed his father's footsteps into finance but later distanced himself from the family business to pursue his own path. Meanwhile, Alexander has embraced and expanded upon his father's legacy, becoming increasingly visible in both philanthropic and political circles.</p>

<h2>What is Alexander Soros's connection to his father's activities?</h2>

<p>Alexander Soros is George Soros's son and actively continues his father's work in philanthropy. He leads the Open Society Foundations and is the founder of the Alexander Soros Foundation, which focuses on promoting social justice and human rights. Alexander shares many of his father's ideas and supports his efforts in various areas, including establishing government accountability and democratic processes at the international level. He also serves on the boards of directors of several organizations involved in human rights and environmental protection. Thus, Alexander Soros plays an important role in continuing and developing the philanthropic activities initiated by his father.</p>

<p>The transition of power from George to Alexander represents more than mere succession planning—it ensures the continuity of an ideological project that transcends the lifespan of its original architect. While George Soros, now in his 90s, has gradually reduced his public profile, Alexander has become an increasingly visible representative of the family's interests and values, suggesting that the Soros influence on global affairs will extend well into the future.</p>

<p>In recent years, Alexander has stepped decisively into his father's shoes. According to my research, he has had significantly more access to the current White House administration than his father did, meeting with senior officials numerous times. This transition of influence from father to son represents not just a family legacy but a continuation of a particular vision for global society that both share.</p>

<h2>What is the story behind George Soros's engagement to a yoga instructor half his age?</h2>

<p>In 2012, George Soros announced his engagement to Tamiko Bolton, who at the time was a 40-year-old yoga instructor, while Soros was 82 years old. This news caused considerable public resonance due to the significant age difference between the fiancé and fiancée. The engagement reportedly took place during the celebration of Soros's 82nd birthday in a small circle of relatives and friends. For Soros, this was his third marriage, and for Bolton, her second. They had met several years prior. In September 2013, George Soros and Tamiko Bolton were married. The mention of this engagement reflects public interest in the personal life of the famous billionaire.</p>

<p>The media focus on Soros's third marriage exemplifies the public fascination with his personal decisions, even those unrelated to finance or politics. The significant age gap between the couple predictably generated tabloid headlines, yet the marriage has proven durable, suggesting a connection deeper than critics initially acknowledged. This aspect of Soros's life offers a glimpse of the man behind the public persona—someone who, despite his extraordinary wealth and influence, still seeks the same human connections that motivate us all.</p>

<p>What's less known is that Bolton is far more than just a yoga instructor. She is a successful entrepreneur who founded an internet-based dietary supplement and vitamin sales company and later an education consultancy. Their relationship, which began when they met in 2008, represents Soros's private life which stands in contrast to his public persona.</p>

<h2>What criticisms and controversies are associated with George Soros's activities?</h2>

<p>George Soros's activities have provoked significant criticism and are the subject of numerous controversies. He is accused of speculations that lead to financial crises and destabilize the economies of entire countries. His active intervention in politics and funding of various organizations are viewed by some as attempts to undermine national sovereignty and impose a certain ideology. Soros has also become a central figure in many conspiracy theories, which accuse him of aspiring to world domination and undermining traditional values. Far-right politicians and populists often see him as the embodiment of globalism and use his image to mobilize their supporters. In some countries, the activities of his foundations have been deemed undesirable and restricted. Despite this, many recognize his contribution to supporting democracy, human rights, and science, especially during periods of political and economic transformations.</p>

<p>The depth and breadth of anti-Soros sentiment around the world has few parallels in modern times. In countries like Hungary (his birthplace), Russia, Turkey, and others, he has been transformed into something approaching a political archvillain—a convenient scapegoat for nationalist leaders seeking to explain social or economic challenges. This demonization often transcends normal political criticism and enters the realm of conspiracy theory, with claims about Soros's influence becoming increasingly detached from factual reality.</p>

<p>As I explore in detail in <a href="../books/george-soros">George Soros: The Man the World Hates</a>, the criticisms of Soros often transcend rational political disagreement and enter the realm of demonization. He has become a convenient scapegoat for a wide range of political actors—from authoritarian leaders seeking to explain away domestic problems to conspiracy theorists looking for a shadowy puppetmaster. What makes Soros unique is that he has been villainized by opposing sides: by communists for undermining their regimes and by right-wing nationalists for promoting progressive values.</p>

<h2>What were the activities of the Alexander Soros Foundation?</h2>

<p>The activities of the Alexander Soros Foundation focus on promoting social justice and human rights. The foundation was established by Alexander Soros in 2012.</p>

<p>Among the main areas of the foundation's activities:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Providing grants to non-profit organizations working in the field of social justice and human rights.</li>

    <li>Supporting organizations such as Bend the Arc, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, which represents the rights of 2.5 million domestic workers in the United States, and Make the Road New York, which provides support to Latin American and working communities.</li>

    <li>Funding research in human rights and social justice; in particular, the foundation, together with the Ford Foundation and Open Society Foundations, funded the first-ever national statistical study of domestic workers.</li>

    <li>Presenting the ASF Award for activities in environmental protection and human rights to Liberian activists, starting from 2012. Among the award recipients were activists from Liberia, Cambodia, Peru, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Papua New Guinea, and Brazil for their work in protecting the environment and the rights of indigenous peoples.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the Alexander Soros Foundation continues the philanthropic activities of the Soros family, paying special attention to issues of social justice and the protection of human rights at the international level. Alexander Soros shares his father's ideas and supports his efforts in various fields.</p>

<p>While George Soros's philanthropy has often focused on broad systemic change through promoting democratic institutions and open societies, Alexander's initiatives suggest a more targeted approach that addresses specific contemporary concerns like environmental justice, labor rights, and immigration. This evolution may reflect both generational differences in philanthropic philosophy and the changing nature of global challenges in the 21st century.</p>

<p>The foundation represents the younger Soros's specific interests while maintaining the family's broader philosophical commitment to open society principles. While George Soros's philanthropy has been expansive and wide-ranging, Alexander has shown a particular focus on environmental justice and labor rights—reflecting perhaps the concerns of a new generation of progressive philanthropists.</p>

<h2>What role did George Soros play in the 1992 "Black Wednesday" currency crisis?</h2>

<p>The event that perhaps most defines George Soros's public image is his role in the 1992 British currency crisis. On September 16, 1992—a day that would later be dubbed "Black Wednesday"—Soros and his Quantum Fund took a massive short position against the British pound, essentially betting that the currency would fall in value.</p>

<p>This speculation came at a crucial moment when the United Kingdom was struggling to maintain the pound's fixed exchange rate within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). The Bank of England tried desperately to prop up the pound by using foreign exchange reserves to buy pounds and by raising interest rates—which reached an extraordinary 15% in a single day. Despite these efforts, the pressure was too great, and the British government was forced to withdraw from the ERM, allowing the pound to float freely and ultimately depreciate by 15% against the German mark and 25% against the US dollar.</p>

<p>For Soros and his fund, this bet resulted in a profit estimated at over $1 billion—earning him the nickname "the man who broke the Bank of England." For the British economy, it meant a significant loss of foreign exchange reserves and considerable embarrassment for the government.</p>

<p>"Black Wednesday" encapsulates both Soros's financial brilliance and the ethical ambiguities that surround financial speculation. The episode demonstrated his extraordinary ability to identify flawed policy arrangements—in this case, the UK's unsustainable position in the ERM—and position himself to profit from their inevitable collapse. Yet it also raised profound questions about the power of private financial actors to challenge the economic decisions of democratically elected governments.</p>

<p>What makes this episode particularly interesting is Soros's own commentary on it. When asked if he felt guilty about potentially destabilizing the British economy, he famously remarked: "Nothing personal—it's business." Years later, however, in his memoirs, he suggested a more personal motivation, noting that he "dropped the pound sterling" partly because Britain "did not accept him" during his student years at the London School of Economics.</p>

<p>This apparent contradiction—between the cold, calculating financier and the man harboring personal grudges—exemplifies the complex nature of Soros that I explore in my book.</p>

<h2>How did George Soros's childhood experiences shape his worldview?</h2>

<p>George Soros's formative years were marked by extraordinary circumstances that profoundly shaped his later philosophy and actions. Born into a Jewish family in Budapest just as antisemitism was rising across Europe, Soros experienced firsthand the existential threat of Nazi persecution. In 1936, fearing growing anti-Semitic sentiments, the family changed their Jewish surname Schwartz to the more Hungarian-sounding Soros—a decision that would prove crucial for their survival.</p>

<p>When Hungary became a satellite state of Nazi Germany during World War II, the local fascist regime began persecuting Jews on a large scale. During this perilous time, 14-year-old György (as he was then known) survived by posing as a Christian, an experience he has described as formative to his character. In his own words: "I am a Hungarian Jew who escaped the Holocaust by successfully posing as a Christian. I was only 14 at the time, and I saw with my own eyes how people, my compatriots, were sent to concentration camps. I can say with certainty that it was during this period that my character was formed. It was formed because I had to calculate everything in advance."</p>

<p>The experience of living under false identity in Nazi-occupied Hungary provided Soros with a first-hand understanding of how quickly societal norms can collapse and how easily vulnerable minorities can be scapegoated. This lived experience profoundly influenced his later commitment to promoting open, pluralistic societies that protect individual rights and prevent the emergence of authoritarian regimes. It also fostered in him an unusual degree of adaptability and emotional resilience in the face of adversity—traits that would serve him well in the volatile world of financial markets.</p>

<p>Perhaps most remarkably, Soros has acknowledged that this experience did not create the psychological trauma one might expect. He once candidly stated: "In fact, one could say that I helped confiscate property from Jews, even though I was a pure-blooded Jew myself. They say such an experience could have driven many people to the doors of a psychiatric clinic, but for me, it didn't create any difficulties at the time, and I felt absolutely no guilt."</p>

<p>His father, Tivadar, emerged as a heroic figure during this period, using his skills in document forgery to save not only his own family but many other Jewish families in Budapest. George later described 1944 as "the happiest year of his life" because he witnessed his father's heroism—a statement that critics have sometimes taken out of context to portray Soros in a negative light.</p>

<p>These experiences—living under false identity, witnessing both the worst of human cruelty and remarkable courage, and developing the ability to adapt quickly to dangerous circumstances—formed the foundation of Soros's worldview. They helped shape his deep skepticism of rigid ideologies, his belief in the importance of open societies that protect individual freedoms, and his willingness to take contrarian positions regardless of popular opinion.</p>

<p>For a more comprehensive exploration of how these early experiences influenced Soros's development and his later financial and philanthropic activities, I recommend reading my book <a href="../books/george-soros">George Soros: The Man the World Hates</a>, which provides a detailed psychological portrait of this complex and controversial figure.</p>
