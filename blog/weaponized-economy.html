<p><strong>What if the most dangerous weapon of the 21st century isn’t a missile, but a spreadsheet?</strong></p>

<p>In an age where military confrontation is too risky, the world’s superpowers have turned to economic warfare — tariffs, sanctions, embargoes, and trade blockades. These tools are subtle, strategic, and often more destructive than bombs. <em>Weaponized Economy</em> by Michael Rodriguez unravels this hidden battlefield, where currencies and commodities become weapons of domination.</p>

<h2>📘 What You’ll Discover</h2>

<ul>
  <li>How Napoleon's Continental Blockade paved the way for modern economic sanctions</li>
  <li>Why the Opium Wars were the original blueprint for Western economic conquest</li>
  <li>The true cost of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff and how it led the world into World War II</li>
  <li>Why modern conflicts with China, Russia, and Iran mirror centuries-old economic strategies</li>
  <li>What economic weapons the future may hold — from digital currency wars to green tariffs</li>
</ul>

<h2>🌍 A Global History of Economic Conflict</h2>
<p>This book is not just for economists or historians. It's for anyone trying to make sense of the chaotic headlines: US vs. China, Western sanctions on Russia, the rise of BRICS.
