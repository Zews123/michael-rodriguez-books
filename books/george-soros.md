## About the Book

When preparing material for a study of outstanding personalities, I always emphasize the analysis of human qualities that made my subject who they became. Today's book examines probably the most controversial, ambiguous, and influential financier of our time—George Soros.

If there were ever a ranking of individuals whose financial decisions affected the fates of the greatest number of people, Soros would undoubtedly be in the top three. You've certainly heard conspiracy theories about how certain shadow groups control global politics. In this book, I reveal the true story of a real person whose influence on world processes is documented and undeniable.

**"George Soros: The Man the World Hates"** takes you behind the headlines to understand how one man can influence the economies of entire countries—not small states, but economic giants like Great Britain. You'll become familiar with the mechanisms that allowed Soros to earn billions through speculation, while entire governments were forced to deal with the consequences of his actions.

From his famous attack on the Bank of England to his philanthropic activities across Eastern Europe and beyond, this meticulously researched investigation examines Soros's role in various crises, revolutions, and political transformations around the world.
