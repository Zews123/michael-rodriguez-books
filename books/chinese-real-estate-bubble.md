## About the Book

When was the last time you heard about China? Was it about their technological advancements? Their economic growth? Or perhaps their real estate market troubles?

**"The Chinese Real Estate Bubble"** takes you behind the façade of the Middle Kingdom's prosperity to reveal a giant that could collapse at any moment. This meticulously researched book explains the preconditions for a deep economic crisis in China, discusses how critical the decline might be, and most importantly, how it will affect all our lives, regardless of where we are geographically located.

With little hyperbole and substantial data, Rodriguez unveils the real process that has already begun and is unfolding right before our eyes. The conclusion is sobering: without exaggeration, none of us will be spared from the consequences of this impending crisis.

## Why This Book Matters for American Readers

Before diving into the details of the Chinese crisis, let's discuss why this topic should concern you if you live in the United States:

- American companies like Apple, Nike, and Starbucks derive a significant portion of their revenues from China
- China has accounted for about 30% of global economic growth over the past decade

The Chinese crisis is not just their internal problem but a full-scale economic storm that will inevitably reach American shores.
