## About the Book

At 6:47 AM on March 15, 2019, FBI agents stormed a gleaming Manhattan office tower, targeting what appeared to be a respectable consulting firm. Instead, they discovered the nerve center of a $2.8 billion money laundering operation that processed criminal proceeds automatically—while its operators slept.

**"The Laundromat: How Presidents, Billionaires and Drug Lords Built the World's Biggest Money-Washing Machine"** exposes the century-long evolution of the world's most sophisticated criminal industry. From Prohibition-era gangsters pioneering the first systematic money laundering techniques to AI-powered systems that clean billions through automated transactions, this groundbreaking investigation reveals how a $32 trillion shadow economy operates parallel to legitimate finance—larger than the combined economies of America and China.

Rodriguez takes you inside the hidden world where dirty money becomes clean: Swiss banks that laundered 350 tons of Nazi gold during World War II, Meyer Lansky's Caribbean empire that created the offshore banking industry, the BCCI scandal that revealed how entire banks could become criminal enterprises, and Panama's transformation into a narco-state under Manuel Noriega. But this isn't just history—it's a blueprint for understanding how digital currencies, NFTs, and artificial intelligence are revolutionizing financial crime for the 21st century.

Drawing from leaked documents, court records, and whistleblower testimonies spanning decades, this explosive exposé connects the dots between seemingly separate scandals: How did the Russian Laundromat move $20 billion through correspondent banking networks? Why do cryptocurrency schemes now process more dirty money than traditional banks? How are quantum computers poised to either eliminate financial crime or make it completely undetectable?

As central bank digital currencies threaten to create unprecedented government surveillance while blockchain technology promises perfect anonymity, understanding the evolution of money laundering becomes essential for grasping the forces that will shape humanity's financial future.

- Swiss banks still hold an estimated $2.4 trillion in questionable offshore wealth despite decades of supposed reforms and international pressure
- Cryptocurrency money laundering reached $14 billion in 2021 and continues growing as new privacy technologies emerge faster than law enforcement can adapt
- A single money laundering operation today can span 40+ jurisdictions and process billions through networks that appear completely legitimate
- Major international banks pay fines averaging just 3-7% of their laundering revenues, making financial crime a profitable business model

## About the Author

Michael Rodriguez is a leading investigative journalist and financial crime analyst specializing in offshore banking, money laundering networks, and the intersection of illicit finance with global power structures. With over fifteen years of experience tracking dark money flows through international financial systems, Rodriguez has established himself as one of the foremost experts on how the ultra-wealthy use shadow banking to evade taxes, launder criminal proceeds, and influence democratic institutions.

"The Laundromat" represents Rodriguez's most comprehensive investigation into the century-long evolution of money laundering, from Prohibition-era gangsters to AI-powered cryptocurrency schemes. His investigative methodology combines traditional financial journalism with cutting-edge data analysis, utilizing leaked documents, court records, and whistleblower testimonies to trace money flows that span decades and cross dozens of jurisdictions.

Rodriguez's previous works include "Dark Money Empire: Inside the Secret Laundering Networks of Presidents, Oligarchs, Nazis and Rock Stars," "Bilderberg Exposed: The Shadow Architects of Global Power," "Digital Dollar Dystopia," "How the IMF Manipulates Countries," "The BlackRock Empire," "George Soros: The Man the World Hates," "The PayPal Mafia," "Weaponized Economy," "The Chinese Real Estate Bubble," "The Trillion Dollar Shadow," and "Silver Empire."

What sets Rodriguez apart is his ability to humanize complex financial crimes by focusing on their real-world impact on ordinary citizens. While other analysts get lost in technical details, Rodriguez consistently demonstrates how offshore tax evasion directly translates to underfunded schools, crumbling infrastructure, and weakened democratic institutions. His work reveals that financial crimes aren't victimless—they represent a systematic theft from the societies that enable wealth creation in the first place.
