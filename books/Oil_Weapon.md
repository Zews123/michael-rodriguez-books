## About the Book

Picture this: A single Ukrainian drone, smaller than a washing machine and costing less than a luxury car, streaks through the Russian night sky and strikes the Ryazan Oil Refinery. Within minutes, infrastructure worth hundreds of millions of dollars erupts in flames visible from space. Within hours, global oil prices spike. Within days, energy stocks plummet across continents.

This isn't just another military strike‚Äîit's the latest chapter in a 150-year story of how energy became the ultimate weapon of mass economic destruction. From John D. Rockefeller's ruthless Standard Oil monopoly to the petrodollar system that props up American financial dominance, from the energy warfare that destroyed the Soviet Union to the precision drone strikes rewriting the rules of modern conflict, "The Oil Weapon" exposes the hidden mechanisms that have shaped our world.

Through three years of investigation across thirty-seven countries, author Michael Rodriguez reveals the classified documents, leaked intelligence, and insider testimonies that show how oil isn't just a commodity‚Äîit's the master key to global power. Every major economic crisis, every world war, every rise and fall of empires can be traced back to energy control.

But now, for the first time in history, that control is slipping away from the superpowers and into the hands of anyone with the right technology and strategic vision.

## What You'll Discover

### üõ¢Ô∏è **The Rockefeller Playbook**
How a 24-year-old bookkeeper created the template for energy domination that every oil empire still follows today‚Äîand why his methods are more relevant now than ever.

### üí∞ **The Petrodollar Empire** 
The secret 1945 handshake deal between FDR and Saudi Arabia that gave America more economic power than any empire in history‚Äîand how it's finally unraveling.

### üéØ **Ukraine's Drone Revolution**
Meet "Madyar," the commander whose \$15,000 drones are systematically destroying Russia's energy infrastructure and proving that superpower energy dominance is ending.

### üåê **The Seven Sisters Cartel**
The shocking truth about how oil companies coordinate to control global prices while maintaining the illusion of free markets‚Äîrevealed through leaked internal documents.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Energy Warfare 2.0**
How AI, quantum computing, and space-based solar power are creating new forms of energy control that could make oil-based geopolitics look primitive.

### üîÆ **The Price Collapse Prophecy**
Why J.P. Morgan's top energy analyst predicts oil will fall to \$58/barrel by 2026‚Äîand what this means for the countries and companies built on energy dominance.
