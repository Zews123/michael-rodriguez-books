## About the Book

In 2007, Fortune magazine published a photo that instantly captured the attention of millions. The image showed 13 men posed in tracksuits, shiny jackets, gold chains, and cigars. The headline read: "Meet the PayPal Mafia."

**"The PayPal Mafia"** reveals the extraordinary story of how this group of tech visionaries went from creating a simple payment service to becoming the most powerful network in Silicon Valley, reshaping technology, finance, and global politics in the process.

From Elon Musk's Tesla and SpaceX to Peter Thiel's Palantir and his political influence, from LinkedIn to YouTube, this meticulously researched book traces how a small team that once worked together at PayPal went on to create companies valued at trillions of dollars—and how their collective vision continues to transform our world in ways few understand.
