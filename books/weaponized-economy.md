## About the Book

When was the last time you heard about trade wars in the news? In today's world, economic sanctions, tariffs, and embargoes have become the weapons of a new era—often no less destructive than traditional military actions.

**"Weaponized Economy"** provides a comprehensive investigation into how nations have increasingly turned to economic tools as weapons in global conflicts. From Napoleon's Continental Blockade to the modern US-China trade war, Rodriguez traces the evolution of trade wars and shows how they have affected the fates of entire nations and changed the contours of world politics.

This meticulously researched book reveals the shocking consequences of economic sanctions and why they often bring pain not only to those against whom they are directed but also to those who initiate them.

## What You'll Discover

- How Napoleon's Continental Blockade became the first global economic war, and why it ultimately contributed to his downfall
- The devastating story of the Opium Wars and how Britain weaponized trade to subjugate China
- How the Smoot-Hawley Tariff deepened the Great Depression and set the stage for World War II
- The Cold War's economic battlefield between the US and USSR, and the technological embargo that changed history
- Modern case studies of sanctions against North Korea, Iran, and Russia—and their surprising results
- An in-depth analysis of the current US-China trade war and its implications for the future global order
- The psychology behind trade wars and why national pride often trumps economic self-interest

## Why This Book Matters Now

For American readers, understanding the mechanisms of trade wars is particularly important, as the United States traditionally plays a central role in the world economy and often uses economic leverage in its foreign policy. From the Smoot-Hawley Tariff to recent measures against China, the economic policies of the United States have repeatedly changed the course of world history.

This book will help you understand the true nature of economic warfare and its consequences for the global economy, international relations, and your own financial future.
