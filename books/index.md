## About the Book

Picture this: A Texas oilman's grandson becomes CIA Director, then President. His son follows him into the White House two decades later. Between them, they launch four wars in the Middle East, preside over three economic crashes, and build a political dynasty that secretly controlled American foreign policy for nearly a century. All while their family business partners made billions from the very conflicts they orchestrated.

This is the Bush Machine: America's most powerful political dynasty, built on a foundation of oil money, intelligence connections, and backroom deals that transformed a Connecticut senator's son into the architect of the modern surveillance state. A family whose fingerprints appear on every major American foreign policy decision from World War II to the War on Terror, yet whose true influence has remained hidden behind layers of corporate shells, classified documents, and carefully managed public personas.

Through unprecedented access to declassified CIA files, leaked financial records, and exclusive interviews with former intelligence operatives, cabinet officials, and family insiders, "The Bush Machine" exposes how four generations of one family weaponized American power to serve their business interests while convincing the public they were serving the nation.

Michael Rodriguez spent five years investigating across seven countries, analyzing thousands of pages of declassified documents, offshore banking records, and secret intelligence assessments to trace the hidden networks connecting Yale's Skull and Bones society to Saudi oil fields, from CIA black sites to Carlyle Group boardrooms, from BCCI money laundering to Halliburton war profits.
