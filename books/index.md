Rodriguez is known for his meticulously researched books that reveal the hidden mechanisms behind global economic systems:

### The Chinese Real Estate Bubble (2025)
An in-depth investigation into China's precarious real estate market and how its potential collapse could trigger a global economic crisis. This book explains the historic roots of China's construction boom, the demographic factors exacerbating the situation, and the worldwide implications of a Chinese economic downturn.
