# THE RIGGED GAME: How the 1% Built a System to Keep You Poor

*By Michael Rodriguez*

*First edition: August 2025  
Published by Resource Economics Press

## About the Book

Picture this: You wake up tomorrow morning to discover that ten men—just ten human beings—have accumulated more wealth than 3.8 billion people combined. Half the planet's entire population. Every construction worker in Bangladesh, every teacher in Brazil, every farmer in Nigeria—all of them together possess less than these ten individuals.

You'd think this was dystopian fiction. But it's happening right now, today, while you're reading these words.

Welcome to the most perfectly rigged game in human history.

Rodriguez spent eighteen months following money trails through leaked documents, court records, and offshore databases that most people will never see. He interviewed former investment bankers who built the modern financial system, ex-government officials who watched it take over their countries, and reformed money launderers who helped hide trillions from public view.

What he found will fundamentally change how you see the world around you. This isn't a story about exceptional entrepreneurship or revolutionary innovation. This is the story of a system so expertly designed to concentrate wealth that it makes the pharaohs of ancient Egypt look like amateurs.

## What You'll Discover 

### 🤖 The Dutch Innovation That Started It All
How 17th-century Amsterdam bankers created the first systematic wealth concentration machine, establishing techniques still used by today's financial elite to drain resources from entire nations.

### 💰 The $2 Trillion Secret They Don't Want You to Know
Why capitalism isn't broken—it's working exactly as designed. Every crisis, every market crash, every "too big to fail" bailout isn't a bug in the system, it's a feature.

### 🎭 Adam Smith vs. Karl Marx: The Battle for Capitalism's Soul
The intellectual war that still shapes economic policy today, and why understanding their debate is crucial for recognizing how the "invisible hand" became a visible fist of concentrated power.

### 🌐 How John D. Rockefeller Built the Modern Monopoly Template
The systematic techniques pioneered by 19th-century robber barons that evolved into today's corporate empires, from Standard Oil to Amazon.

### ⚠️ Why Every Dollar in Their Accounts Represents Your Lost Opportunity
How wealth concentration isn't just about rich people getting richer—it's about the systematic transfer of resources away from schools, infrastructure, and healthcare.

### 🔮 The Viable Alternatives They're Terrified You'll Discover
Proven cooperative models and democratic ownership structures already working around the world, and why they represent the oligarchy's greatest fear.

## Key Revelations

- How the wealthiest 1% built a system that automatically channels money upward, regardless of merit or innovation
- The specific financial engineering techniques that turned market capitalism into wealth extraction machinery  
- Why deglobalization might finally break the concentration system—and what that means for your financial future
- The real reason wages have stagnated while asset prices soared: it's not technology, it's intentional design
- How offshore banking networks evolved from Dutch innovations into today's $32 trillion shadow economy
- The cooperation models already proving that democratic ownership can outperform extractive capitalism

This isn't just analysis—it's a roadmap for understanding the most important economic transformation of our time. The rigged game can only continue as long as enough people keep playing by rules written by and for the winners.
